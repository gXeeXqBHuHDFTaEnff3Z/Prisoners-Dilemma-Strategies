# Prisoners-Dilemma-Strategies

The [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) is a game analyzed in game theory. Two players need to decide if they want to cooperate or betray each other. If both players cooperate they get more than betraying partners. But if one partner betrays a cooperating one, the traitor wins big. In the iterated game the players play more than one round with each other, allowing them to learn to trust each other or retaliate.

Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma spiked when Robert Axelrod's reported on a tournament in his book "The Evolution of Cooperation" (1984). The tournament had participants choose their mutual strategy again and again. They also had a memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in the tournament.

In this app you get to try out different strategies and let them compete against each other, just like Axelrod did. You can also create your own strategies, by forking the code. Or you can open an issue and hope someone else implements it for you.
